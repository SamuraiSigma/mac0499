# *Speech to Text* module demos

This directory contains simple games used to test/demonstrate the new *Speech to
Text* module for [Godot][godot].

## Run

First, check that the custom *Godot* engine with the *Speech to Text* module has
been built (see [here](../godot/README.md) for more details).

To run a game, use the [run-game.sh](run-game.sh) script with its directory as an
argument:

    ./run-game.sh <game_directory>
