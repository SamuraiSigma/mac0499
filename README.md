# Development of a speech recognition module for the *Godot* game engine

This repository contains all data, code and texts for my **Supervised Gruaduate
Project (MAC0499)** at [IME-USP][ime-usp].

## Summary

[Godot][godot] is a open source 2D and 3D game engine, its code being available on
[GitHub][godotGitHub]. The software allows the creation of new modules to extend its
functionalities without modifying its essence.

This project's goal is to develop a STT (Speech to Text) module for *Godot* and then
present the new functionality in a simple game.

## Repository organization

This project consists in the following directories:

- [**game**](game/): Contains any simple games, made in *Godot*, to demonstrate the
new STT module.

- [**godot**](godot/): A submodule which is a fork of *Godot*. The new module,
*Speech to Text*, was developed here, in *Godot 2.1.3*.

- [**monograph**](monograph/): A monograph registering steps done in the project (in
*Portuguese*).

- [**speech-recognition**](speech-recognition/): Contains submodules for speech
recognition libraries, as well as instructions and code on how to build them. Any
experiments done separately for each library are also located here.
