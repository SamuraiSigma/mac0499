# Supervised Graduate Project

This repository contains all data, code and texts for my **Supervised Gruaduate
Project** at [IME-USP][ime-usp].

## Title

***Development of a module for the Godot game engine***  
*(Note: This title is currently temporary)*

## Summary

[Godot][godot] is a open source 2D and 3D game engine, its code being available at
[GitHub][godotGitHub]. The software allows the creation of new modules to extend its
functionalities without modifying its essence.

This project's goal is to develop a new module for Godot and then present the new
functionality in a simple game. While the module theme still isn't 100% defined,
the most researched option was *speech recognition*.

## Schedule

*(To be done)*

## Repository organization

This project consists in the following directories:

- **monograph/**: A monograph registering steps done in the project (in
