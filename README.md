# Development of a speech recognition module for the *Godot* game engine

This repository contains all data, code and texts for my **Supervised Undergraduate
Project (MAC0499)** at [IME-USP][ime-usp].

## Summary

[Godot][godot] is a open source 2D and 3D game engine, its code being available on
[GitHub][godotGitHub]. The software allows the creation of new modules to extend its
functionalities without modifying its essence.

The main goal is to develop a STT (Speech to Text) module for *Godot* and then
present the new functionality in a simple game.

## Repository organization

This project consists in the following directories:

- [**game**](game/): Contains any simple games, made in *Godot*, to demonstrate the
new STT module.

- [**godot**](godot/): All *Godot*-related files are stored here. This is also where
the new module, *Speech to Text*, was developed.

- [**monograph**](monograph/): A monograph, written in *LaTeX*, registering steps
done in the project (in *Portuguese*).

- [**poster**](poster/): A poster summing up the whole project.

- [**slides**](slides/): Presentation slides, written in *LaTeX*, registering steps
done in the project (in *Portuguese*).

- [**speech-recognition**](speech-recognition/): Contains submodules for speech
recognition libraries, as well as instructions and code on how to build them. Any
experiments done separately for each library are also located here.

## Submodules

There are a few *git* submodules in this project. To initialize and update all of
them, use the following command:

    $ git submodule update --init
