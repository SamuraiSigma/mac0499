# Development of a speech recognition module for the *Godot* game engine

This repository contains all data, code and texts for my **Supervised Gruaduate
Project (MAC0499)** at [IME-USP][ime-usp].

## Summary

[Godot][godot] is a open source 2D and 3D game engine, its code being available on
[GitHub][godotGitHub]. The software allows the creation of new modules to extend its
functionalities without modifying its essence.

This project's goal is to develop a *speech recognition* module for Godot and then
present the new functionality in a simple game.

## Repository Organization

This project consists in the following directories:

- [**godot**](godot/): Godot submodule. The new module will be developed here. (*To
be done*)

- [**monograph**](monograph/): A monograph registering steps done in the project (in
*Portuguese*).
