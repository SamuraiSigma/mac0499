# *Godot*

This directory contains a fork of the [Godot][godot] game engine, as well as a fork
of the *Godot* documentation repository.

## *Speech to Text* module

The *Speech to Text* module was developed in the *Godot* fork at [engine](engine/).
It was created based on *Godot 2.1.3*, but it should probably be compatible with
future 2.1 versions as well.

To easily build and/or run the engine, use the [build-helper.sh](build-helper.sh)
script available in this directory:

    $ ./build-helper.sh -h  # Displays usage of the script
