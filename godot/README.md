# *Godot*

This directory contains a fork of the [Godot][godot] game engine, as well as a fork
of the *Godot* documentation repository.

## *Speech to Text* module

The *Speech to Text* module was developed in the *Godot* [fork][godotGitHub] at
[engine](engine/). It was created based on *Godot 2.1.3*, but it should probably be
compatible with future 2.1 versions as well.

To easily build and/or run the engine, use the [godot-builder.sh](godot-builder.sh)
script available in this directory:

    $ ./godot-builder.sh -h  # Displays usage of the script

## *Godot* docs

The [docs](docs/) directory is a [fork][godotDocsGitHub] of the *Godot*
documentation repository. Updated with information on the *Speech to Text* module.
